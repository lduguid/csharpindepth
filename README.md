General Notes
=============

Evoltion of Product type, showing greater encapsulation, stronger typing, and
ease of initialization over time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C# 1
----
* read-only properties
* weakly typed collections

C# 2
----
* private property setters
* strongly typed collections

C# 3 
----
* automatically implemented properties
* enhanced collections and object initialization

C# 4
----
* named arguements for clearer constructor and method calls.


Features involved in making sorting easier in C# 2 and 3.
---------------------------------------------------------

C# 1
----
* weakly typed compartor
* no delegate sorting option

C# 2
----
* strongly typed comparator
* delegate comparisons
* anonympous methods

C# 3
----
* lambda expressions
* extension methods
* options of leaving list unsorted


Anonymous methods and lambda expressions in C# 2 and 3 aid seperation of concerns and readability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C# 1
----
* Strong coupling between condition and action.
* Both are hardcoded.

C# 2
----
* seperate condition from action invoked.
* Anonymous methods make delegates simple.

C# 3
----
* lambda expressions make the condition even easier to read.
